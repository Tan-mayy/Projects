Internship project at ISRO 
Which shows a 3D model of Akatsuki Satellite by Japan which orbits around Venus... The model can be rotated and revolved freely around the camera in the cartesian plane X, Y and Z. The code is written in Python and Time, Vpython modules are used for the creation of this 3D simulation. The complete model is in shape.py

And tt.py shows how the satellite revolves around venus and how it sends data to earth there a special case where blind spot is generated when the satellites hides behind the planet venus during its revolution phase.
